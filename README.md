Data Source
The sales data for this dashboard originates from a MySQL database. It includes historical sales data containing information about products, customers, sales dates, and geographical regions. The data has undergone exploratory querying and analysis to ensure its accuracy and relevance to the dashboard's objectives. I have provided the created database and uploaded the file as db_dump.

Dashboard Features
Sales Overview: Get an at-a-glance summary of overall sales performance, including total revenue, number of orders, and average order value.
Yearly Insights: Analyze sales trends over the years with a visual representation of yearly revenue, allowing you to identify growth or decline patterns.
Date-wise Analysis: Dive into sales data on a daily basis, helping you understand which days of the week or months are most profitable.
Geographical Breakdown: Explore sales performance across different geographical areas using interactive maps and filters.
Product Analysis: Gain insights into product-wise revenue and sales quantities to determine top-selling products and their contributions.
KPI Monitoring: Monitor key performance indicators like sales growth rate, customer retention, and more, providing a holistic view of business performance.
